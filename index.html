The city may have flourished as late as until 13th century, as indicated by a Paramara inscription.

                The Kuntala country is an ancient Indian political region which included the north-western parts of Mysore and the southern parts of the Bombay Presidency.[1] Kuntala coins are available since estimated 600-450 BCE.[2] Kuntala formed one of the divisions of Southern India as late as 10th-12th centuries A.D. (other regions were: Chola, Chera, Pandya Telangana and Andhra). Each developed its own culture and administration. The Talagunda inscriptions mention Balligavi and nearby regions as parts of Kuntala. Inscriptions in Kubaturu near Anavatti mention Kubaturu as the Kuntalanagara. Kuntala is revered as one of the three great countries of Chalukya period in inscriptions.
